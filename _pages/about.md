I'm a molecular biologist interested in developing and testing gene drives and other genetic technologies to control pest insect species.  

Currently based at the [University of East Anglia](https://people.uea.ac.uk/p_leftwich) I teach across a range of subjects including molecular biology, genetics, statistics and computing skills.


Here you can find information on my research, current projects, and find details about teaching and outreach projects.
