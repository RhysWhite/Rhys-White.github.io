In 2022, we went into a pet shop and collected a faecal sample from a healthy (asymptomatic) pet bird. We discovered that a strain of _Chlamydia psittaci_ found in a pet bird in 2022 is very similar to the _C. psittaci_ strains that caused foal loss in horses in 2016. This is a bit concerning because it means that there's a possibility that people and animals could get sick from _C. psittaci_, so we need to keep a close eye on it to make sure everyone stays healthy. To do that, we need to figure out who is giving _C. psittaci_ to whom so we can come up with evidence-based ways to stop _C. psittaci_ from spreading.

Abstract
======
_Chlamydia psittaci_ is a zoonotic pathogen that infects birds, humans, and other mammals. Notably, recent studies suggested the human-to-human transmission of _C. psittaci_, and this pathogen also causes equine reproductive loss in Australia. Molecular studies in Australia to date have focused on and described clonal sequence type (ST)24 strains infecting horses, wild psittacine, and humans. In contrast, the genetic identity of _C. psittaci_ strains from captive psittacine hosts is scarce. In 2022, _C. psittaci_ was detected in the faeces of a healthy captive blue-fronted parrot (_Amazona aestiva_). Genomic DNA was extracted and underwent whole-genome sequencing. Here we report the 1,160,701 bp circular chromosome of _C. psittaci_ strain BF_amazon_parrot13 and the 7,553 bp circular plasmid pCpsBF_amazon_parrot13. Initial _in silico_ multi-locus sequence typing and _ompA_ genotyping revealed that BF_amazon_parrot13 belongs to the clonal ST24 lineage and has an _ompA_ genotype A. Further context involved the genomes of 31 published ST24 strains, utilising a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) based clustering approach. Despite temporal, host, and biogeographical separation, a core-genome SNV-based phylogeny revealed that BF_amazon_parrot13 clustered in a distinct subcluster with seven _C. psittaci_ strains from equines in Australia (maximum pairwise distance of 13 SNVs). BF_amazon_parrot13 represents the first complete _C. psittaci_ ST24 genome from a captive psittacine in Australia. Furthermore, by using whole-genome sequencing to coordinate surveillance, we can also learn more about the possible health risks and routes of chlamydia transmission among people, livestock, wild animals, and domesticated animals.
