We present the first two complete _C. pecorum_ genomes sequenced from diseased koalas. With these genomes, we expand on previous works by improving the gene annotations and by providing the genomic context of important virulence and accessory gene content. These findings lay the foundations for identifying and understanding species specificity and host adaptation behind chlamydial infections affecting koalas.

Abstract
======
_Chlamydia pecorum_, an obligate intracellular pathogen, causes significant morbidity and mortality in livestock and the koala (_Phascolarctos cinereus_). A variety of _C. pecorum_ gene-centric molecular studies have revealed important observations about infection dynamics and genetic diversity in both koala and livestock hosts. In contrast to a variety of _C. pecorum_ molecular studies, to date, only four complete and 16 draft genomes have been published. Of those, only five draft genomes are from koalas. Here, using whole-genome sequencing and a comparative genomics approach, we describe the first two complete _C. pecorum_ genomes collected from diseased koalas. A _de novo_ assembly of DBDeUG_2018 and MC/MarsBar_2018 resolved the chromosomes and chlamydial plasmids each as single, circular contigs. Robust phylogenomic analyses indicate biogeographical separation between strains from northern and southern koala populations, and between strains infecting koala and livestock hosts. Comparative genomics between koala strains identified new, unique, and shared loci that accumulate single-nucleotide polymorphisms and separate between northern and southern, and within northern koala strains. Furthermore, we predicted novel type III secretion system effectors. This investigation constitutes a comprehensive genome-wide comparison between _C. pecorum_ from koalas and provides improvements to annotations of a _C. pecorum_ reference genome. These findings lay the foundations for identifying and understanding host specificity and adaptation behind chlamydial infections affecting koalas.
