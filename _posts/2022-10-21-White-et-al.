In Australia, novel _Chlamydia psittaci_ infections in horses raise biosecurity concerns. Here, we used limited whole-genome sequencing to figure out â€™who is giving it to whoâ€™ and when these modern _C. psittaci_ strains may have appeared in Australia. Our findings suggest that strains from parrots and horses have likely descended from a single progenitor strain.

Abstract
======
_Chlamydia psittaci_ is an avian pathogen with zoonotic potential. In Australia, _C. psittaci_ has been well reported as a cause of reproductive loss in mares which subsequently have been the source of infection and illness in some in-contact humans. To date, molecular typing studies describe the predominant and clonal _C. psittaci_ sequence type (ST)24 strains in horse, psittacine, and human infections. We sought to assess the clonality between ST24 strains and the emergence of equine ST24 with a comprehensive genomics approach. We used culture-independent probe-based and metagenomic whole-genome sequencing to investigate 13 _C. psittaci_ genomes from horses, psittacines, and a pigeon from Australia. Published genomes of 36 _C. psittaci_ strains were also used to contextualise our Australian dataset and investigate lineage diversity. We utilised a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based clustering and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) approach. _C. psittaci_ has four major phylogenetic groups (PG1-4) based on core-genome SNP-based phylogeny. PG1 contained clonal global and Australian equine, psittacine, and human ST24 genomes, with a median pairwise SNP distance of 68 SNPs. PG2, PG3, and PG4 had greater genomic diversity, including diverse STs collected from birds, livestock, human, and horse hosts from Europe and North America and a racing pigeon from Australia. We show that the clustering of _C. psittaci_ by MLST was congruent with SNP-based phylogeny. The monophyletic ST24 clade has four major sub-lineages. The genomes of 17 Australian human, equine, and psittacine strains collected between 2008 and 2021 formed the predominant ST24 sub-lineage 1 (emerged circa 1979). Despite a temporal distribution of 13â€‰years, the genomes within sub-lineage 1 had a median pairwise SNP distance of 32 SNPs, suggesting a recent population expansion or potential cross-host transmission. However, two _C. psittaci_ genomes collected in 2015 from Victorian parrots clustered into distinct ST24 sub-lineage 4 (emerged circa 1965) with ovine strain C19/98 from Germany. This work describes a comprehensive phylogenomic characterisation of ST24 and identifies a timeline of potential bird-to-equine spillover events.
